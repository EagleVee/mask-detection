Mask Classifier



Coronavirus has now become the talk of the town,
Like most people in the world right now are suffering badly and everyday thousand's of people are dying because of COVID-19,
Iâ€™m genuinely concerned about them
In the above project i used web scrapped data with classes people wearing mask and no mask and trained a resent 50. Then i used the model to predict on a webcam feed


Installation:

All the required installation are mentioned in the requirements.txt


Usage:

Step 1:training the model with the appropriate data with training.ipynb, downloading the model weights.

Step 2:add the model weight in label.py program and execute it.

Step 3:finally run webcam.py, the webcam output gets saved as out.mp4.
